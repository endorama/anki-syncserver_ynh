Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

This package installs the Anki Sync Server, which allows you to host your own synchronization server for the Anki flashcard application instead of using AnkiWeb.

**Features:**
- Self-hosted synchronization for Anki
- Support for multiple users (up to 5 configurable via config panel)
- Configurable upload limits
- Works with Anki desktop and mobile clients
